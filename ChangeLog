Version 0.9 : 13 Oct 1996

Put the thing together in 3 nights of hacking...  now waiting for bug
reports.

Version 1.00 : 16 Oct 1996

Fixed a bunch of bugs, added the whole messagearea thing + the
resources. 

Version 1.01 : 2 Nov 1996

Added the arrow keys to move the brick around, and a key to drop one
step down.  Fixed a glitch in the README.

Version 1.10 : 8 Nov 1996

Made the server auto-speedup the game, and added -nospeedup to toggle it
off.  Added -norestart and -nospeedup to xtris (just passes them to the
server).  Added a counter for the lines in the current game, and for the
number of games the player has won, as well as a button, key and X
resource to reset the games counter.  Increased the size of all buffers
in xtris from 1k to 4k after some overflow errors were reported.  Made
the bot modular so it the decision algorithm can be modified on its own
easily, and replaced it with a much better version.  Added a -test mode
for the bot that just tests how good the automatic player is.  Clicking
on the Next zone toggles displaying the next brick.  Rewrote the docs
about the client/server protocol. 

Version 1.0.1 of the client/server protocol : 8 Nov 1996

Added the optional argument to OP_NEW, and the commands OP_ZERO and
OP_WON.  This is mostly compatible with the old protocol, except that
with new clients and an old (1.0.0) server the game counters will never
increase.

Version 1.11 : 9 Nov 1996

Added -daemon to xtserv.

Version 1.12 : 9 Nov 1996

Bugfix in the automatic increasing of levels (could coredump xtris).

Version 1.13 : 10 Nov 1996

Cosmetic fix in the text entry areas.  Bugfix in the growing of lines
that would cause the display to be incorrectly updated on other players'
screens.  Added more buffering in xtris and xtbot to group write()s to
the server.

Version 1.14 : 29 Mar 1997

Added the -n command-line option to specify the nick, and the "name"
resource.  Changed a few variable names which conflicted with BSD 4.4
systems like FreeBSD.

Version 1.15 : 14 Dec 1997

Bugfix in the window resize code; resizes didn't work with mwm or CDE.


Version 1.16 (win32): 2004-05-24

Ported to win32. When started on non-standard port, both xtbot and
xtserv are started on same port. (Xtserv can only be started if you
try to start xtris on IP 127.0.0.1).


Version 1.17 (win32): 2004-05-25

Colors were inversed from original version. Sometimes there were problems with
screen repainting.


Version 1.18 (win): 2016-09-28

On windows the movements were "stalled" between each server step. I.e. the
client would not update the screen before getting the next message from the
server, leading to a "laggy" experience. This commit fixes that. Also added
code to github.
